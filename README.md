## what is this

a completely subjective, incomplete, maybe even totally incorrect (I mean probably not totally...), list of companies that seem awesome. to me.

## what's awesome, how do you even define that

yeah no exactly, it's a meaningless way of describing companies. I mean awesome means they're not terrible, but what's "terrible"? like... what if Enron's work family balance was actually excellent... errrr sorry

## uhh could you explain that again without the weird Enron analogy

awesome companies are companies that do awesome work, have awesome people, and are fun and pleasant to work at.

it's something about whether projects are fun/playful, whether it's contributing to making the world a better/more beautiful/more quirky place (or is it about squeezing out some delta from the alpha from the - you know, making something more efficient in a way that makes everything slighly more terrible)

## so it's so subjective that you don't really know

I mean, """""I know when I see it", but applied to tech-y-ish companies? sure, there will be disagreements and that's fine. but you know.

awesome companies.

companies that are not dreadful. but more than that. cause that's too low of a bar...

## ok can you show me the list then

yes.
